  "summary": "The diff shows a partial implementation focused on frontend scaffolding and routing. Basic layouts, authentication hooks, and placeholder admin/client pages are present. However, the BuildRequest demands extensive backend logic (Motoko actors for wallets, ROI engines, binary matching, reward engines), complete frontend pages with all specified content, and full integration. The diff is heavily truncated, making it difficult to verify most requirements. Based on visible evidence, many core features are missing or incomplete.",
